# Horiseon Refactor Code Challenge Resubmission

## Purpose
My purpose for this challenge was to review code for the Horiseon company website and tighten up the HTML to be more logical & semantic (REVIEWER PLEASE see the code in the index file outlining the semantic html!), and to improve SEO by adding alt tags to their images and other graphics. Also I needed to reorder the  css and add comments.

## Aims
1. WHEN I view the source code I find semantic HTML elements (REVIEWER PLEASE check the index.html file for semantic elements.)

2. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements, I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

3. WHEN I view the image elements I find accessible alt attributes

4. WHEN I view the heading attributes they fall in sequential order

5. WHEN I view the title element I find a concise, descriptive title
